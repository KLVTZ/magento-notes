13: Understanding Fallback Model
================================
Magento offers us the ability to add our own themes. Magento offers two places
that we need to edit. The first is within our `app/design/frontend/rwd`. This
folder contains the logic for layouts, NOT design! It contains templates,
configs, as well as other core phtml files for each template.

The other place we have to add more settings to is our skin folder. The skin
folder is directly associated with all our front-end resources. This includes
our `css`, `img`, as well as other dependencies. 

We took a look at how we can adjust our layouts to use default templates. We can
even specify that we would like to see the source of all the views as shown
right now. Just understand that when you add a theme. You have a theme and then
you have the fallback for the default. The default should always be available.
This way, we have a fallback for us to reference.
