11: Understanding loadLayout() and renderLayout()
=================================================
To output views or as magento expresses them, layouts, we must first load the
necessary layouts under our node tree and then render the layout. First, if we
where to load out layout completely. We can then get the layour and grab the
updates and handles. These handles will define how we should render our layout.
This depends where we are in our application as well as whether we are a
logged-in member.

```php
<?php

class TutsPlus_Demo_IndexController extends Mage_Core_Controller_Front_Action
{
	public function sayHelloAction() {
		$this->loadLayout();
		// header('Content-Type: text xml');
		// die($this->getLayout()->getNode()->asXML());
		/* print_r($this->getLayout()->getUpdate()->getHandles()); */
		$this->renderLayout();
	}

	public function indexAction() {
		echo "default action!";
	}
}
```

If we take a look at any actual layout, we can find them under the
`frontend/base/default/layout`. In this example, if we look at `page.xml`. We
find the default layout defined along with multiple options. Another example is
the customer.xml`. Notice we have tags for each of our handlers. Specifially,
these tags will be added to the node tree structure if we are logged in or
logged out. We can actually see what is rendered by die and outputting the node
structure as xml. We will see what was added to the layout and what wasn't.
These two main methods is how we render our layouts and thus load in the proper
resources.
